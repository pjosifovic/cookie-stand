            You need the dark in order to show the light. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.
            Let that brush dance around there and play. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
            Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not every limb is perfect. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Just make a decision and let it go.
            Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.
            It looks so good, I might as well not stop. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just relax and let it flow. That easy. You are only limited by your imagination.
            And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
