          <h3>Sliced Chocolate For Sandwiches Is Now A Reality – Life Will Never Be The Same Again</h3>

            Doctors have been recommending chocolate in your sandwich for years, but the Japanese have finally done it!
            Bourbon, a Japan-based company, has started to sell chocolate slices packaged like Kraft cheese singles.
            Each pack contains five two-millimeter (0.08-inch) thick slices. Bourbon’s online shop offers bulk orders consisting of twelve,
            five-slice packs for 3,240 yen (US$27). The “nama” chocolate used to make the slices is soft and is more intense
            in flavor than milk chocolate. And for our Danish readers: yes, we know of your Pålægschokolade,
            but it’s not soft, is it? More info at their <a href="http://shop.bourbon.jp/" target="_blank">ONLINE SHOP</a>

          <h3>These Nut-Hugging Bear Cookies Are Almost Too Cute To Eat</h3>
          <p class="blogDate">DEC 09th, 2015, Bored Panda</p>

            Maa Tamagosan, a French-trained Japanese cook, just might have created a cookie that is too cute to eat.
            Her cookies look like cute little teddy bears clutching tasty nuts close to their hearts.
            Luckily for us, Maa shared the recipe for these cookies on her blog so that the rest of the world can wrestle
            with the question of whether or not one can eat something so cute. If you have a nut allergy.
            Maa’s original recipe is written in Japanese.
