# Name Of The Project: Salmon Cookie Stand
## Project Author: Pedja Josifovic
## Description:
As a second week project at Codefellow's 201 course, Salmon Cookies Stand application is calculating the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation—10:00 AM to 6:00 PM—and a few factors unique to each location:

* The minimum number of customers per hour.
* The maximum number of customers per hour.
* The average number of cookies purchased per customer.

Built application will be **adaptable**: User will be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, will also be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. These numbers will be nicely formatted in a web application.
